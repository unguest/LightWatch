# LightWatch
LightWatch maybe the thiniest media reader ever.

## How does it works ?
You just have to specify the path to your file or the url to the online content via the dedicated buttons and here you are !

## How could it be as light as it is ?
I've just implemented the MS Framework but without all the useless options so that is loads faster and become as weight as possible.
